# Company-Network-System
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a secure, redundant, and scalable enterprise network for a 600-user organization using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, OSPF, PAT, SSH, and port security across a three-floor infrastructure.



##  Project Overview

- 600 users across 6 departments
- VLAN segmentation with inter-VLAN routing
- Centralized DHCP server
- OSPF routing protocol for dynamic routing
- NAT (PAT) for internet access
- SSH for secure remote access
- Port security on finance department switch
- Redundancy using two routers, two multilayer switches, and dual ISP connections

##  Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLANs, DHCP, NAT, OSPF, SSH
- Port Security, ACLs
- Wireless Access Points
- Subnetting & IP planning
